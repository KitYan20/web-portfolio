                    As a dedicated Computer Science and Linguistics student at Boston University, 
                    I've actively contributed to the academic community as a Teaching Assistant for the Introduction to Computer Systems course.
                    My tenure here has also been enriched by hands-on experience in diverse personal and group projects. 
                    Through these projects, I've honed a comprehensive skill set encompassing both FrontEnd and BackEnd development, 
                    fostering a deep understanding of the intricacies of software development.
